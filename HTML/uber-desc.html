        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p> Uesugi Kenshin is a nice Midranger with around 76k base HP, 3 KBs and 6400 base DPS, as well as Strong + 100% KB proc against Blacks. With talents, 
            she also targets Relic and gains Curse Immunity, and becomes arguably the best anti-Relic specialist. Kenshin has a high cost of 5475, 405 range, and 18 Speed. Her cooldown is 145s. <br><br>
            Boasting great stats against Relics (effective 11.5k DPS, 190k HP) plus reliable CC, Kenshin is able to effectively counter a good portion of the Relic enemies
            in the game, and holds very well against longer range ones too with her tanky health. Against Blacks, Kenshin is a good attacker, able to hold the frontline and outrange 
            most Black enemies, and can counter tanky ones quite well such as Razorback. Her fast attack rate also helps keep up with enemy spam, especially Black enemies as they are often found in groups. <br><br>
            Kenshin does have a high summoning cost, and this can hurt in end game as some stages are extremely stingy on cash. Mediocre range means she has a difficult time to compete in general usage. 
            While her KB can be great, it can also be harmful at times by pushing the enemy frontline and causing your units to push into the enemy backliner's range, or “Mizli Syndrome”. Against Blacks, her KB isn't very useful 
            as they for the most part already have a high KB count, with the exception of a few like Le'noir and Dark Otta. For Relic usage, she is indeed effective, but requires a hefty NP investment. For general use, her range 
            is too little to work as a reliable backliner but her DPS is a little underwhelming for your typical midrange needs, so best to keep her as a specialist for her target traits. <br><br>
            With her abilities and stats, Kenshin's usage is highlighted in end game as she is arguably the best anti-Relic, and good Relic counters are hard to come across. Prior to that, her usage is only mediocre, 
            with Pizza replacing her niche as an anti-Black, but still works against enemies which Pizza can’t, like Le’noir with her higher backline range. Her role in endgame as a good anti-Relc makes her a valuable unit to obtain.
