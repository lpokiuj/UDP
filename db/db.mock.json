While he has a large blindspot to compensate for this, this can be used to his advantage to keep stepping stones alive while sniping. Although 56% (67% with CotC treasures) uptime on Curse is less than ideal, it can still have some impact, disrupting Alien CC backliners like Corporal Weyland or Calamary, and occasionally holding back peons like Star Peng or Mesocosmocyclone that rely on their Warp to push. He has decent survivability thanks to his good range, and an average cooldown to back it up. First Form has a similar build to Medalist Cat with decent stackable LD DPS, and the addition of a 50 to 60% uptime Curse with a 50% proc rate. When stacked, it can be useful to control melee peons with status effects, mostly Warp.", "Mousse shows that just because something is unique doesn't mean that it's good, though. His safe range comes at the price of lackluster DPS and he often feels like he's barely doing anything. Curse only turns off abilities, and can't do anything against Aliens or Zombies without a status effect, or stop them attacking and advancing like Slow or Freeze would. Especially as his Curse is not even 100% uptime, it can often be too insignificant to really help you. Such a large 450 blindspot is a detriment to anti-Zombie usage, with most of his targets just burrowing past his attacks and killing or ignoring him, too. Although he's an okay anti-Alien in First Form, his low proc chance/uptime and long cooldown make it hard to build the needed stack to get reliable Curse coverage, and Housewife Cat completely outclasses him as an LD midrange anti-Zombie.", "Mousse is decent as a general Sniper / Super Backliner, a rare category. His range is certainly a huge and unique asset. However, his wide blindspot and low DPS can go against him on many stages, especially by late game. His specialist usage is limited by bad matchups with Zombies, relatively useless Curse control with only a handful of potential targets, and a lacklustre First Form which is no better than regular Super Rare LD midrange attackers in most cases."], "Scores": {"Overall Use": 2.5, "Anti-Alien": 2.0, "Anti-Zombie": 1.0, "CC/Support": 0.5, "Sniper": 2.0, "Midranger": 0.5, "Super Backliner": 2.5}}, "525": {"Name": "Kintaro", "Description": ["Kintaro is a decent midrange Sniper with 9100 HP, 840 cost and 1200 DPS at Lvl 30.

His pierce can reach all but a few common Angel enemies and due to his stackability, he has no problem permaslowing everything that walks into his range when taking into account his quick three-part multihit where each hit has 30% chance to proc, giving him a good 65.7% chance to proc per attack cycle. While Sanzo is heavily used in Angel CC, Kintaro provides extra reach in also lowing the mid-backliner enemies such as Angelic Sleipnir and most importantly: Winged Pigge. Kinrangers can be used to snipe super backliner enemies such as Prof. A and Nyandam variants providing there is a stepping stone in front of them due to his incredible piercing range. Angelic Sleipnir, Winged Pigge, and Chickful A are three Angel enemies where his Curse can be put to good use, turning off their annoying status effects. His Slow effect now has a. 87.5% chance of hitting each attack cycle with multi-hit factored in, and can provide consistent long range support. His Savage Blow in very relevant in both forms as Kintaro's stack damage escalates quickly whilst Kinrangers has one of the highest damage outputs for an LD Sniper unit.", "While on paper, Kintaro has the capability of slowing melee Angel enemies such as Gabriel and Angelic Gory but when put into practice, he does struggle a lot when his Slow doesn't proc and they quickly push into his small but visible blindspot. One hit from Angelic Gory is enough to severely damage or even kill him outright ruining all chances of a stack being formed. Kinrangers suffers from extraordinarily high speed causing him to clip and making his standing range an inaccurate representation of his true placement in front of enemy units whilst also taking unnecessary early damage since he just rockets past any and all meatshields. It should be noted that this can be easily alleviated by sending him later once a decent meatshield wall has been established. Additionally Kinrangers' foreswing can feel a little sluggish at times, giving time for enemies to interrupt his attacks.", "Kintaro actually reaches almost all common Angel enemies with his pierce so if it's strictly slowing Angels you need then First Form is best. His TF is used for more consistent Slow if stepping stones aren't available along with additional range + Curse options. It should also be noted that he requires two Elder Catfruit to True Form which is both costly and locking him behind SoL completion. His Evolved Form is still available to use and is very similar to his True Form although lacking the Curse ability.

This greatly increases her survivability on the field. LWC Yuki also has a shorter than average cooldown.

Besides, her role as a general Backliner suffers from lower than average DPS too and most other ubers of the same role outclasses her. This makes her very replaceable generally (still usable if all you have is Crazed Bahamut), and gets outclassed in late game by even no gacha options like Awakened Ururun.

Wave Immunity ensures that he can easily destroy most wave stages in the game with his DPS, outranging most common wave enemies.", "All of this may seem very impressive, but Dark Aegis Garu has several major weaknesses that can prevent him from being as good as he first seems. The first is its sub-par survivability outside of the Traitless category. An insufficient base HP and KB count, at a low-end standing range leaves him vulnerable to enemy backliners and fast pushers. Mixed or Traited stages will often punish this and by late game, he will often not survive the early stages of a tough battle.

Her Evolved Form's extra range lets her work against a much larger variety of enemies, including many that non-Uber CC units have poor matchups against, reaching backliner Blacks like Le'noir and Aliens like Ursamajor, and can function as support without needing to be stacked due to the 100% Slow chance.", "Kaguya of the Coast's main problem is the fact that her main niches of CCing Blacks and Aliens are done better by Bombercat and Seafarer, respectively.

Weaken, while not the most desirable or highest quality CC ability out there, can prove useful at times to debilitate enemies which your other units cannot outrange and therefore unavoidably take damage from. In particular she has good matchups against Professor A, weakening him so your Islands can approach and land hits more easily, and against Angelic Sleipnir, who while weakened will trigger your rebound attackers more times before killing them.

Her CC, in both quality and desirability, is rather underwhelming. With a subpar 65% uptime and Weaken generally being less relevant than Slow or Freeze, her CC is mostly treated as a bonus rather than a useful control option. Against Zombies her matchup is rather poor; she suffers against burrowing and reviving Zombies as they can bypass her range advantage and her long TBA and foreswing mean she usually can't respond to their ambushes in time to avoid losing a large chunk of HP. Her long 3.4s foreswing also makes her prone to whiff attacks, lowering her effective DPS and CC reliability.
